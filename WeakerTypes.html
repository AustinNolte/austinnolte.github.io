        Pokemon types of course also have the weaker links of the pack. Taking a
        look at some of weaker pokemon we can see a common type being
        <strong>Bug</strong>. Even though there are strengths to this type, it
        doesn't have enough to justify the inherent weakenesses of them. They
        are only typically useful for offense against Psychic types. Taking a
        look at the weak types the common theme is that they are predominately
        weak to a lot and niche in what they are strong against. One of the
        weakest pokemon is Caterpie, which ironically is also one of the more
        popular ones. Here is an image of Caterpie

        To make it into a neat list and very generalized as it is all in
        nuiance. Pokemon with the following types are typically the weakest in
        no particular order.<br />
        <strong>Bug</strong> <br />
        <strong>Ice</strong> <br />
        <strong>Rock</strong> <br />
        <strong>Normal</strong> <br />
