        Even though all of the pokemon have their own strengths and weaknesses
        there are of course some that are stronger than others. Generally
        speaking, <strong>Dragon</strong> is typically one of the strongest
        types in pokemon. This is because of its great defensive abilities.
        Another type that is very defensively strong is Steel. Thanks to this
        pokemon such as <strong>Dialga</strong> is one of the stronger pokemon
        in terms of defensive abilities. This is because it is a dragon/steel
        type combination. Here is a picture of dialga.
